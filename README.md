# SMS-Spam-Detector-96-
This project is a machine learning-based SMS spam detection system, developed using Python. The system classifies SMS messages as either spam or not spam by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a Logistic Regression model. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of SMS messages and uses TF-IDF for feature extraction.
